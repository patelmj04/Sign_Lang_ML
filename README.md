# Sign Language Recognition System

## 🎯 Project Overview
The **Sign Language Recognition System** is an AI-powered solution that enables real-time recognition of sign language gestures and translates them into text. This project aims to bridge the communication gap for the hearing-impaired community by leveraging deep learning techniques and computer vision.

## 📌 Features
✅ Real-time sign language detection and translation  
✅ User-friendly interface for accessibility  
✅ Scalable and efficient deep learning model  
✅ Flask-based web deployment  
✅ Open-source and customizable for further improvements  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV
- **Backend:** Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of a diverse set of images representing different sign language gestures. It has been preprocessed and augmented to improve model accuracy and generalization.

## 📌 How It Works
1. The system captures hand gestures using a webcam.
2. The image is processed and fed into a trained deep learning model.
3. The model predicts the corresponding sign and converts it into text.
4. The translated text is displayed on the user interface.
